A question I have for mike about [[level-1]]
    Hey [[Mike]]  - weird thing happened, for a bit I couldn't seem to write or edit, now I can. Bizarre
real question - this is set up to download for windows. Is there a mac version of this process? Or maybe I should just set up my windows machine for this and go from there.

And another bit of text to test a commit to master branch
